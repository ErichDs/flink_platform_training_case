# This repo has part of the original material of the RockTheJvm Flink Training with Code written by me during the course.

This repository contains the code we wrote during  [Rock the JVM's Flink course](https://rockthejvm.com/course/flink). Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

The code here may be different from the original material due to personal changes or comments made by me.
